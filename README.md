# QuizFight
This project was developed as part of the training for IT specialist for application development for the programming lessons at the vocational school.

## How it works
In Quizfight you have the possibility to get various items like armor or weapons, you can either get them from Lootboxes or buy them via in-game currency. With the help of this equipment, you then fight against another player in a quiz. If you answer a question correctly, you do damage to the opponent; wrong answers have no effect on a player's HP. The first player to run out of HP loses. Each question gives a different amount of in-game money due to its difficulty.
